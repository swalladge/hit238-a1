A webapp for Assignment 1, HIT238. Copyright Â© 2016 Samuel Walladge


## Info

The web app is statically generated using Jekyll. This enables a neat project structure, use of preprocessors, and
simple to change things like the subpath of where it is hosted. 

Liquid templates are used for neat html page development with more
[DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself), and Sass css preprocessing for things like variables in
css for easier consistency.

To build a hostable version of the app, edit `_config.yml` to ensure config such as the baseurl are set as required,
and then run `jekyll build` from the project directory. This will output all the files for the site under the `_site`
directory. These can be copied directory to the web server where they are to be hosted.

In the web app itself, jQuery Mobile is used as the web framework, with a custom theme generated with
[ThemeRoller](http://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/). jQuery and Underscore.js are heavily used throughout, especially
for ajax calls, data manipulation, DOM manipulation, and template rendering (for displaying data in the app).
